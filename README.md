## 💿 Install

To setup this project install npm and then run a dev server locally:
```console
npm install
npm run dev
```

If you desire it you can also build it with `npm run build`. This creates an dist directory, which can be used by any webserver you want (But you cant click the index.html and run it in your local Browser.)
If you want to serve the dist folder you can also run it for example with python webserver in your commandline.
```console
cd swordWeirdoDistFolder
python3 -m http.server 8080
```
